# Komodo-Mlipir Algorithm (Binary Version)

The **Komodo-Mlipir Algorithm** is a metaheuristic-based optimization algorithm designed to find the optimum value of a function. This repository contains the binary version of the algorithm, adapted from the original [MATLAB implementation](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/102514-komodo-mlipir-algorithm) and specifically modified for feature selection problems.

## Current Development
1. Specific implementation for feature selection.
2. Implemented several transfer functions, namely s-shaped. v-shaped, and time-varying s-shaped and time-varying v-shaped.
3. There are several runners for specific experiments, single or multi-runs.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/komodo-mlipir-algorithm-binary.git
cd komodo-mlipir-algorithm-binary
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in the required format.
2. Install libraries needed (numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and pandas)
3. Configure the algorithm parameters in the script.
4. Run the algorithm:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
